# ToDo menu description
This is a ToDo manager addon (currently only supports Godot 4.x).

> This addon is a work-in-progress, so there may be massive changes made without warning, and it might be very buggy. Please report all bugs so I can fix them.


## Features
The addon adds a ToDo tab to the bottom panel, which looks like this when clicked:

This allows you to add notes for things you want to add or change. When you finish doing something, you can press the arrow button to move the item to the Changelog.

The Changelog can be used to remind you what you have changed and acomplished on that day. It might be motivational, but in the future I plan on adding a feature to create a changelog text that can be copy-pasted into your website or a GitHub project page.

Every day uses a different horizontal box, keeping it more organized.
